This resource could not have been made without the hard work of xTxVxTx (Discord: @xTxVxTx#4282) and you should visit their Tebex shop and show support for their high quality and affordable weapon, player model, and map improvements. https://xtxvxtx-mods.tebex.io/

And the testing and object hunting of Popcorn RP! Come join us to be a part of our community! https://discord.gg/popcornroleplay 

This group of files replaces and moves the majority of for sale, for rent, and for lease type signs across the map. Most visibily, forclosure and for sale signs in all the residential areas are gone. Why would you want this? For Roleplay communities that provide player housing, it's common to hear "Can you remove the forclosure sign from in front of my house?"

While a great fit for the GTA 5 Universe and reflective of the housing crisis after 2008, the signs don't really fit into most "modernized" and current roleplay universes.

**To Install:**

1. Put this in your resources folder wherever you keep streamed assets.
2. Open your server.cfg file, or through your config in TxAdmin, and add ensure popcornrp-xtxvxtx-nosalesigns to it's own line

That's it!

Although tested with multiple different servers and multiple MLO makers like Gabz, FM, Molo, etc. to make sure there was no conflicts, but if the designer is using any of the replaced props they may be missing or cause issues. This is your responsibility to diagnose and we will not provide assistance.

If you encounter any issues with any of the assets causing crashes, please make sure to test it with multiple users and let us know in issues.
